## Receipt Scanner

### How Receipt Scanning Works

The receipt scanner uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to automatically extract information from receipt images:

1. **Image Processing**: Receipt images are optimized for better OCR accuracy
2. **Text Extraction**: Tesseract.js extracts text from the processed image
3. **Data Parsing**: Smart algorithms identify amounts, dates, vendors, and items
4. **Review Process**: You can review and edit extracted data before creating expenses

### Uploading Receipts

#### Method 1: Drag and Drop
1. Navigate to the "Receipts" tab
2. Drag receipt images directly onto the upload area
3. Multiple images can be uploaded simultaneously

#### Method 2: File Selection
1. Click "Select Images" button
2. Choose receipt images from your file system
3. Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP formats

### Receipt Processing Workflow

#### 1. Upload Status
- **Pending**: Receipt uploaded, waiting for processing
- **Processing**: OCR is currently analyzing the image
- **Completed**: Processing finished, data extracted
- **Failed**: Processing encountered an error

#### 2. Reviewing Extracted Data

When processing completes successfully, you'll see:

- **Amount**: Detected total amount (usually the largest number)
- **Vendor**: Identified store or business name
- **Date**: Extracted transaction date
- **Items**: List of individual items with prices

#### 3. Creating Expenses from Receipts

1. Review the extracted information for accuracy
2. Click "Create Expense from Receipt" (coming soon)
3. The system will pre-fill the expense form with extracted data
4. Make any necessary corrections
5. Save the expense

### Best Practices for Receipt Scanning

#### Photo Quality Tips
- **Good Lighting**: Ensure the receipt is well-lit
- **Flat Surface**: Place receipt on a flat, contrasting background
- **Full Receipt**: Capture the entire receipt including totals
- **Clear Image**: Avoid blurry or tilted photos
- **High Contrast**: Dark text on light background works best

#### What Gets Extracted
- **Total Amount**: The final amount paid
- **Vendor Name**: Store or business name
- **Transaction Date**: When the purchase was made
- **Individual Items**: Line items with descriptions and prices
- **Confidence Level**: How confident the OCR is about the data

## Categories and Organization

### Default Categories

Your application comes with these pre-configured categories:

| Category | Icon | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| üõí Groceries | Green | Food and household items |
| üí° Utilities | Yellow | Electricity, gas, water, internet |
| üè† Rent | Red | Housing costs |
| üöó Transportation | Blue | Gas, public transit, parking |
| üé¨ Entertainment | Purple | Movies, dining, leisure |
| ‚öïÔ∏è Healthcare | Pink | Medical, pharmacy, insurance |
| üìù Other | Gray | Miscellaneous expenses |

### Using Categories Effectively

#### Best Practices
1. **Be Consistent**: Always use the same category for similar expenses
2. **Use "Other" Sparingly**: Try to fit expenses into existing categories
3. **Tag for Subcategories**: Use tags to create subcategories within main categories

#### Example Categorization
```
Groceries:
- Weekly shopping: Groceries + tags: "weekly, food"
- Household supplies: Groceries + tags: "supplies, cleaning"

Transportation:
- Gas: Transportation + tags: "gas, vehicle"
- Public transit: Transportation + tags: "transit, metro"
```

### Tags for Enhanced Organization

Tags provide additional organization beyond categories:

#### Effective Tag Strategies
- **Frequency**: "weekly", "monthly", "annual"
- **Necessity**: "essential", "luxury", "emergency"
- **Person**: "john", "mary", "shared"
- **Project**: "apartment", "vacation", "work"

#### Tag Examples
```
Rent payment: Category: Rent, Tags: "monthly, essential"
Emergency repair: Category: Other, Tags: "emergency, apartment"
Date night: Category: Entertainment, Tags: "monthly, couple"
```
